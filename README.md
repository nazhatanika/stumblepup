# Web Development Project 4 - *StumblePup*

Submitted by: **Anika Nazhat**

This web app: **StumblePup is a random dog discovery web app inspired by the old StumbleUpon experience. With the click of a button, users can fetch a new, random dog along with consistent attributes like breed group, temperament, and life span as well as a photo. Users can customize their discovery experience by clicking on any attribute to ban it, which prevents future dogs with that trait from appearing. The ban list is interactive and easily editable, allowing users to refine what they see with each click.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed: 

- [X] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
  - The type of attribute displayed for each image should be consistent across API calls (i.e. if you are using a cat API, and display the color, breed, and age in response to an initial API call, subsequent button clicks should also result in the color, breed, and age being displayed)
- [X] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
  - A single result of an API call is displayed at a time 
  - Displayed attributes should match the displayed image (i.e., if showing a picture of a Siamese cat and the attribute breed, the displayed breed should be 'Siamese' not 'Ragdoll' or another breed that doesn't match)
  - There is at least one image per API call
- [X] **API call response results should appear random to the user**
  - Clicking on the API call button should generate a seemingly random new result each time
  - Note: Repeat results are permitted but the API used should have a reasonably large amount of data and repeats should not be frequent
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban **list**
  - At least one attribute for each API result should be clickable
  - Clicking on a clickable attribute not on the ban list, should imnmediately add it to the ban list 
  - Clicking on an attribute in the ban list should immediately remove it from the ban list 
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**
  - Clicking on the API call button should not result in any image/attributes with attribute values in the ban list being displayed (ex. Using a cat API, if the ban list includes the value 'Siberian' for the breed attribute, clicking on the Discover button should never result in a Siberian cat being displayed)
  - Note: More attribute values on the ban list may result in a higher frequency of repeat results
  -  [X] _To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes_


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple types of attributes are clickable and can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously displayed  results from this session
  - A dedicated section of the application displays all the previous images/attributes seen before
  - Each time the API call button is clicked, the history updates with the newest API result

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: I always tend to struggle most with CSS implementation. It also took me a lot of practice to understand how APIs work.
